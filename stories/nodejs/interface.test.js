/**
 * @todo write tests for the interfaces StdIn, StdOut, Locale, Frame, FrameProps and View in NodeJS with vitest.
 * Follow the actor / scenario model.
 * Basic interfaces must include:
 * - read text from stdin
 * - write text to stdout
 * - read an option from a selectbox with the bordered frame
 * - write result to stdout
 *
 * Frames and Views must follow the blessed interface as for flexibility.
